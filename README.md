SciGregator 
-----------
is an open source project I am developing that seeks to answer [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6356790) question.

**SciGregator** will be an open source project that will work as a news 
aggregator site might.  I will base this off of the rules that Hacker News
follows and will seek to create an open platform where scientists can submit
academic papers (that have not been published) that the community finds
interesting.  I think my initial market will be college kids (friends that I know)
writing papers on stuff the community finds relevant and interesting and
could be a source for furthering research.

My stack will most likely be the web.py framework on google app engine (since 
the two play nicely together from what I've seen) and html and css thrown on top
Not entirely sure what to do about building a database for comments for 
articles but that's what side projects are for!
